# Projects

## Chatbot
Use case:
This client wanted to have a ChatBot functionality on their webpage. A small icon on the bottom right that when clicked would open a chatbot. The chatbot back end was developed with Amazon Lex.
It opened an embedded iframe that was hosted on S3 with CloudFront.
It had pre-programmed phrases to send to the chat bot, in addition to being able to type in any message desired.

Front End:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Backend: 
* Amazon Lex
* API Gateway

## Call Recording Search
Use case:

The hosted telephony system in-use only kept recorded calls for up to 1 year. The regulations of this organization required call recordings to be kept for 7 years.
I utilized the IP Telephony's ability to upload directly to Amazon S3. Upon upload, a lambda function was called to update the database with the metadata of the file.

On the front end, users that are permitted to log in and query the database were created in AWS Cognito. From this login they could search for and retrieve wav files of the recorded calls based on the call metadata stored in the database. 

Backend:
* Python
* Lambda
* API Gateway
* RDS Aurora

Front End: 
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Cognito for Authentication
